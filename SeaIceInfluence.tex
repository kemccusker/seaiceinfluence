\abstract{Changes in Arctic sea ice play an important role in modulating surface fluxes of heat and moisture, and therefore local near-surface temperatures and precipitation. Whether or not historical sea-ice retreat has had a marked influence on weather patterns, particularly outside the local region, remains an open and important question. Here the effect historical sea-ice loss has on the atmosphere is isolated by prescribing observed sea-ice concentrations and local sea surface temperatures in an atmosphere model. A suite of 120-year simulations is carried out to temper natural variability. We find that observed boundary conditions produce a lowering of Arctic sea level pressure in Autumn that is robust and consistent with other studies, but no clear signal in patterns of variability emerge. Furthermore, the response to observed sea-ice changes is compared to a suite of simulations in which boundary conditions are obtained from an ensemble of historical simulations from a coupled global climate model. We find that whereas near-surface temperature responds in accordance with the amount of sea ice loss --- more loss yields larger warming --- sea-level pressure and geopotential heights remain slave to natural variability. Individual ensemble members have regions and seasons of statistically significant circulation changes in response to sea-ice loss, however those regions and seasons are not robust across ensemble members. Thus, it is likely that 1. historical sea-ice loss played a minimal role in setting circulation trends and 2. any detectable effect sea-ice loss had is due to @@ Thus, caution must be taken when interpreting even long time-slice simulations  @@.

\section{Introduction}

Arctic sea ice has been making a dramatic transformation over the late 20th and early 21st century due in large part to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Sea ice concentrations are at record lows since at least 1900@@, multi-year ice is reducing, and the ice overall is thinner. These changes are both caused by greenhouse warming and help to amplify greenhouse warming in the high northern latitudes such that the Arctic is warming at a rate 2-3 times as large as the rest of the globe (@@). The reduction in sea-ice area unmasks the ocean below, allowing more heat to flux from the warmer waters to the relatively cold atmosphere. The question remains as to how large of an influence this loss of sea ice has on the atmosphere, both locally and remotely.
