\abstract{Changes in Arctic sea ice play an important role in modulating surface fluxes of heat and moisture, and therefore local near-surface temperatures and precipitation. Whether or not historical sea-ice retreat has had a marked influence on weather patterns, particularly outside the local region, remains an open and important question. Here the effect historical sea-ice loss has on the atmosphere is isolated by prescribing observed sea-ice concentrations and local sea surface temperatures in an atmosphere model. A suite of 120-year simulations is carried out to temper natural variability. We find that observed boundary conditions produce a lowering of Arctic sea level pressure in Autumn that is robust and consistent with other studies, but no clear signal in patterns of variability emerge. Furthermore, the response to observed sea-ice changes is compared to a suite of simulations in which boundary conditions are obtained from an ensemble of historical simulations from a coupled global climate model. We find that whereas near-surface temperature responds in accordance with the amount of sea ice loss --- more loss yields larger warming --- sea-level pressure and geopotential heights remain slave to natural variability. Individual ensemble members have regions and seasons of statistically significant circulation changes in response to sea-ice loss, however those regions and seasons are not robust across ensemble members.

\section{Introduction}

Arctic sea ice has made a dramatic transformation over the late 20th and early 21st century due in large part to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Sea ice concentrations are at record lows since at least 1900@@, multi-year ice is declining, and the ice overall is thinner. These changes are both caused by greenhouse warming and help to amplify greenhouse warming in the high northern latitudes such that the Arctic is warming at a rate 2-3 times as large as the rest of the globe (@@). The reduction in sea-ice area unmasks the ocean below, allowing more heat to flux from the warmer waters to the relatively cold atmosphere. The question remains as to how large of an influence this loss of sea ice has on the atmosphere, both locally and remotely.

Much study has 

An important question

Lit review here.
Studies that implement time-slice simulations with similar prescribed boundary conditions from comparable time periods 

It is worth noting that the vast majority of previous studies investigating the response of the atmosphere to changes in sea ice have been accomplished under two model lineages: National Center for Atmospheric Research Community atmosphere models, and atmosphere models developed by the Hadley Centre. Thus, a primary motivation for undertaking this study is to add a much-needed third data point from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis atmosphere model to the growing literature about the influence of sea ice loss on the atmosphere. Moreover, 

\section{Model and simulations}

To isolate the effect of sea ice on the atmosphere, we use the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis fourth-generation atmosphere general circulation model (CanAM4) with prescribed surface boundary conditions and a freely evolving atmosphere. The model is run at T63 horizontal resolution with 37 vertical levels from the surface up to 1hPa. Further model details can be found in @@cite. We execute a suite of 121-year time-slice simulations and analyze the last 120 years in the results. Each simulation is prescribed with an annually repeating seasonal cycle of sea-ice concentration (SIC), sea-ice thickness (SIT), and sea surface temperatures (SST) as described below. The greenhouse gas, tropospheric aerosol, and solar levels are set to 1984 conditions for all simulations. In this way, any resulting changes in climate can be attributed to changes in the prescribed surface forcing alone.

\subsection{Boundary conditions}
\subsubsection{Observations}

In order to investigate the effect of observed sea ice loss on the atmosphere, we utilize gridded sea-ice concentration and sea surface temperature data prepared by the Hadley Centre (Hadley Centre sea ice and SST dataset, version 1.1; HadISST1.1). While HadISST1.1 has some known biases @@cite, it is somewhat of an "industry standard" and has been used as boundary conditions for IPCC Atmosphere Model Intercomparison Projects (AMIP) as well as previous work attempting to tease out the effect of sea ice loss on the atmosphere @@cite. The effect of sea ice loss is examined over the satellite era, from 1979 onwards, when the observations are most reliable and the changes in sea ice are greatest. As such, to force the atmosphere model, we calculate monthly mean climatologies of HadISST1.1 sea-ice concentration and SST for the mean of years 1979-1989 as the baseline, and 2002-2011 as the perturbation period. These monthly climatologies are used as repeating boundary conditions in CanAM4 for 121 years, as described next. Because the boundary conditions are annually repeating and the atmosphere has a short memory on the timescale of days (@@), each year can be considered an independent realization of the state of the atmosphere. Thus, after throwing out the first year for spin-up, the ensemble size, N, of each simulation is 120. 

The control simulation, forced with repeating 1979-1989 HadISST1.1 climatologies of SIC and SST is known as \textit{CTLhad}. CTLhad sea ice thickness boundary condition data is obtained from the output of a previous CanAM model version (@@). The perturbation simulation, known as PThad, is forced with repeating 2002-2011 HadISST1.1 climatologies of SIC, and SST where SIC declines by 10\% or more. SST is the 1979-1989 climatological value otherwise. In this way, only changes in SST directly attributed to changes in sea ice are incorporated.

Similarly, the perturbation simulation, forced with repeating 2002-2011 HadISST1.1 climatologies of SIC and SST is known as \textit{PThad}. ) and is held constant in PThad, except where SIC disappears, where it is set to zero (@@). The only differences between PThad and CTLhad are the boundary conditions, and so the forcing is effectively the change in SIC
 
\subsubsection{Model}

 We contrast results obtained from forcing with observed sea ice and SST conditions with those 

 obtained from  and historical simulations of the second generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2).
